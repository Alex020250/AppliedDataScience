# Process suggestions

## Necessary preparation steps:
- Managing data type
    - Year: Decimal -> Integer
    - Price: Nominal -> Decimal
- Value check (part of data exploration)
    - designation:
        - Consistent form of values are required. Currently too many values are included due to spelling variations.
            - ex) Zwischen den Seen Trockenbeerenauslese Nummer 7
            - ex) Zwischen den Seen Nr. 7 Trockenbeerenauslese
        - Too many unidentifiable values
            - ex) "P"
            - ex) "S"
    - Producer
        - Some unidentifiable values
            - ex) 0
            - ex) next:
    - vineyard_grape
        - Consistent form of values are required. Currently too many values are included due to spelling variations.
            - ex) Pinot Noir
            - ex) "P" Pinot Noir
            - ex) 'S' Pinot Noir
        - All values that are included only once (Absolute count = 1) can be grouped into large classes.
            - ex) Big Barrel Pinot Noir -> Pinot Noir
            - ex) Big Bat Carbernet Sauvignon -> Carbernet Sauvignon
    - Year
        - There are 14961 rows that do not contain specific year. (Year = 0)
        - How can we handle with such rows?
            - Exclude all rows that do not have year data?
- Manaing "desc" column
    - Categorizing of "desc" column into different levels (Reference: https://winefolly.com/deep-dive/wine-tasting-terms-to-use/#finish)
        - The Fruit Level (1)
        - The Sweetness Level (2)
        - The Body Profile (3)
        - The Finish (4)
        - Should be discussed (?)
    - "desc" column can be splitted into different levels above and plugged in the binary value (0,1)
    - Taste description:
        - fruit (1)
        - acidity (1)
        - ripe (1)
        - rich (3)
        - cherry (1)
        - tannins (3)
        - full (?)
        - black (?)
        - spice (4)
        - sweet (2)
        - aromas (4)
        - oak (4)
        - blend (?)
        - red (?)
        - dark (?) -> color of wine? Or dark-cherry?
        - bodied (3)
        - bright (?)
        - white (?)
        - dry (2)
        - plum (1)
    - It would be nice, if we add some descriptive words like "soft", "smooth", "light", "bold" (Reference: https://www.vivino.com/DE/en/montes-montes-alpha-cabernet-sauvignon/w/71294?ref=nav-search)
