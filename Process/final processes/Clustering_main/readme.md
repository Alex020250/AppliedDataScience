# Wine Clustering

## Files
- Use clustering_main for main insights.
- In Clustering_grouped, we built clusteres grouped by grape color, but this was not that useful.

## Visualizations
- Use cluster_points_tastes with the non-aggregated dataset outputs of k-means and agglomerative.

- Use cluster_color_aggregation_kmeans with the k-means aggregation dataset output.
- Use cluster_color_aggregation_agglomerative with the agglomerative aggregation dataset output.
