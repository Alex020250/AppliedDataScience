## Literature regarding wine and climate

 Seasonal differences in Vitis vinifera L. cv. Pinot noir fruit and wine quality in relation to climate (https://oeno-one.eu/article/view/2427):
- Result: High-quality vintages were linked to warmer than normal growing seasons and below normal precipitation.

Very interesting information about wine building https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fes3.14:
- Overview of the different grapes, when they grow and at which temperature
- Overview of viticultural regions on earth
- Vrsic and Vodovnik (2012) showed that higher temperatures during the growing season in North East Slovenia promoted a significant decrease in the total acidity content of early-ripening varieties.
- Santos et al. (2012a), using a multimodel ensemble for the Douro Valley (Portugal), demonstrated that springtime warming may lead to earlier budburst under a future warmer climate, which may affect wine quality. Additionally, future projections for this same region, suggest higher grapevine yields (Santos et al. 2011) and wine productions (Gouveia et al. 2011), but also suggest increased risks of pests and diseases
