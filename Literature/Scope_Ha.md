# Scope 

## Introduction to use case 
- There were some interesting literature and online sources to find out the relationship between wine taste and climate factors. 
    - According to those sources:
        - Warmer climates: more alcoholic, full-bodied, higher sugar levels, darker color, eaiser ripening
        - Cool climates (less than 15 ℃): crisp, higher-acidity, fresher-flavoured, lighter body, low sugar level, difficult ripening

- As in the second online source, we can divide our climate into four different levels and see how climate factors and wine taste are related.
    - Cold climate (Average temperature: less than 15 ℃)
    - Moderate climate (Average temperature: between 15 ℃ and 18.5 ℃)
    - Warm climate (Average temperature: between 18.5 ℃ and 21.5 ℃)
    - Hot climate (Average temperature: more than 21.5 ℃)

## Goal
- Investigate, whether/how the weather influences the quality of the wine

## Selection of data set
- Combination of two data coming from different data sources.
- Data source: 
    - We found some interesting data on Kaggle, including a wealth of information about wine reviews.
        - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zynicide/wine-reviews
        - According to data description:
            - This data was originally scraped by WineEnthusiast (https://www.winemag.com/?s=&drink_type=wine) the week of June 15, 2017.
